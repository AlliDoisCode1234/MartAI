## Recently Completed (January 15, 2026)

### ✅ Launch Validation & Admin Provisioning

- **E2E Validation**: Validated critical path (User Signup -> Team Subscription -> Project -> Calendar -> Article).
- **Admin Tools**: Implemented `provisionSubscription` for manual Sales/Admin upgrades.
- **Role-Based Access**: Added `sales` role (Level 60) for secure provisioning without full admin access.
- **Team Tier Gating**: Verified API Key access for Team tier ($299/mo).

### ✅ Beta Waitlist Cap Feature

**Board Decision (0.9 confidence):**

- Implemented 101-user cap on beta waitlist in `WaitlistForm.tsx`
- Automatically displays "Beta Full" messaging when count >= 101
- Dynamic headline and social proof updates based on waitlist state
- Convex reactive query ensures real-time UI updates

**Changes:**

- Added `BETA_CAP = 101` constant
- Added `isBetaFull` computed check from `getWaitlistCount` query
- Three-way render: Beta Full > Success > Form
- Orange border highlight on card when beta is full

### ✅ Semantic Sliding Window Duplication Fix

**Board Decision / Context:**
- Addressed major flaw where AI generated duplicate titles due to incorrect context object coercion (`[object Object]`).
- Increased deduplication sliding window history from 15 to 50 articles.
- Imposed rigorous semantic deduplication constraint via global writer personas.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed (March 27, 2026)
