# Internal Linking Strategy: The Missing SEO Lever

**Internal links pass authority and help users navigate.** Learn how to build a strategic internal linking structure that boosts both SEO and UX.

## What is Internal Linking?

Internal linking connects pages within your website. Done strategically, it's one of the most underused SEO tactics.

### Why Internal Links Matter

| Benefit             | Impact                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Passes authority    | Distributes PageRank      |
| Improves crawling   | Helps Google find pages   |
| Builds context      | Shows topic relationships |
| Increases pageviews | Keeps users engaged       |
| Reduces bounce rate | Provides next steps       |

## Internal Linking Fundamentals

### Link Equity Flow

```
              Homepage (High Authority)
                    |
      --------------------------------
      |        |        |           |
   Pillar1  Pillar2  Pillar3   About
      |        |        |
   Cluster  Cluster  Cluster
```

Authority flows from high-authority pages down through links.

### Anchor Text Best Practices

| Type          | Example                       | Use          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| Exact match   | "keyword research"            | Occasionally |
| Partial match | "learn keyword research tips" | Often        |
| Branded       | "Phoo's guide"                | Occasionally |
| Natural       | "this guide"                  | Sparingly    |

> **Tip**: Vary your anchor text. Too many exact matches looks manipulative.

## Building Your Link Architecture

### Step 1: Map Your Content

Organize by topic clusters:

```
SEO Cluster:
├── Pillar: Complete SEO Guide
├── Cluster: Keyword Research
├── Cluster: On-Page SEO
├── Cluster: Technical SEO
├── Cluster: Link Building
└── Cluster: SEO Tools
```

### Step 2: Identify Link Opportunities

For each page, ask:

1. What related content exists?
2. What should readers see next?
3. What terms need explanation?

### Step 3: Create a Link Map

| From Page         | To Page           | Anchor Text                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| /pillar-seo       | /keyword-research | keyword research fundamentals |
| /pillar-seo       | /technical-seo    | technical SEO checklist       |
| /keyword-research | /pillar-seo       | comprehensive SEO guide       |

### Step 4: Implement Contextually

Links should feel natural:

**Good**:

> Once you've completed your keyword research, it's time to focus on [on-page optimization](/on-page-seo) to put those keywords to work.

**Bad**:

> [Keyword research](/keyword-research) is important. Also see our [on-page SEO](/on-page-seo) and [technical SEO](/technical-seo) guides.

## Link Types to Use

### Contextual Links

Links within your content body:

- Most valuable
- Feels natural
- High click-through

### Navigation Links

Menu, footer, sidebar:

- Site-wide authority
- Lower individual value
- Helps crawling

### Related Posts

End-of-article suggestions:

- Keeps users reading
- Medium value
- Should be relevant

## Strategic Link Patterns

### Hub and Spoke

```
        Pillar Content (Hub)
        /    |    \    \
     Spoke Spoke Spoke Spoke
       ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑
       └─────┴─────┴─────┘ (all link back to hub)
```

All cluster content links to the pillar.

### Cross-Linking Clusters

```
Cluster A ←→ Cluster B
    ↓           ↓
Cluster C ←→ Cluster D
```

Related clusters link to each other.

### Tiered Linking

1. **Tier 1**: Homepage → Main categories
2. **Tier 2**: Categories → Pillar content
3. **Tier 3**: Pillars → Cluster content

## Finding Link Opportunities

### Site: Search

```
site:yoursite.com "keyword"
```

Find pages that mention a topic but don't link to the relevant page.

### Screaming Frog

1. Crawl your site
2. Export all pages
3. Analyze internal links per page
4. Find under-linked pages

### Orphan Page Audit

Pages with no internal links pointing to them:

- Hard to find
- Hard to rank
- Should be linked or deleted

## Link Quantity Guidelines

### Per Page Recommendations

| Page Type    | Links Out | Why                      |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------ |
| Pillar       | 10-20+    | Distribute to cluster    |
| Cluster      | 5-10      | Back to pillar + related |
| Blog post    | 3-8       | Relevant content         |
| Product page | 3-5       | Related products         |

### Total Site Guidelines

- Every page should have 2+ internal links TO it
- Important pages should have 10+ links to them
- Maximum ~100 links per page (practical limit)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too few links** - Not passing authority
2. **Only navigation links** - Missing contextual value
3. **Exact match anchors** - Over-optimization
4. **Broken links** - Wasted equity
5. **Orphan pages** - Unlinkable assets

## Maintenance

### Monthly Audit

- [ ] Check for broken internal links
- [ ] Add links to new content
- [ ] Update old content with new links
- [ ] Remove links to deleted/redirected pages
