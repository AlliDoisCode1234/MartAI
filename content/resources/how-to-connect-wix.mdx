## How Wix Publishing Works

Understanding Wix's content model helps with publishing:

```
Create Draft → Review → Publish
     ↓            ↓         ↓
  Saved as    Visible in   Live on
  draft post  Wix admin    your site
```

Phoo creates content as drafts by default. You can:

- **Auto-publish** - Set in publish options for immediate go-live
- **Draft mode** - Review in Wix before publishing

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

### "Invalid API key"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] API key copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- [ ] Key hasn't been revoked or regenerated
- [ ] Using the full key (not account ID)

**Fix:** Generate a new API key and reconnect.

### "Insufficient permissions"

**Cause:** API key missing required scopes.

**Solution:**

1. Go to Settings → API Keys
2. Delete the old key
3. Create a new key with **Wix Blog Read & Write** permissions
4. Reconnect in Phoo

### "Blog not found"

**Cause:** Wix Blog app not installed on site.

**Solution:**

1. Go to Add Apps in Wix
2. Install **Wix Blog**
3. Publish your site with the blog added
4. Retry connection

### "Rate limit exceeded"

Wix limits API calls per minute.

**If you see this:**

- Wait 60 seconds before retrying
- Reduce bulk publishing frequency
- Space out multiple posts

### "Draft created but not published"

**Normal behavior** when using draft mode. To auto-publish:

- Enable "Publish immediately" in Phoo publish options
- Or manually publish in Wix dashboard

| Practice                | Why It Matters                |

| Never share API keys    | They provide write access     |
| Rotate keys annually    | Reduces exposure risk         |
