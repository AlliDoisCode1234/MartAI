## Prerequisites

Before connecting WordPress to Phoo, verify these requirements:

| Requirement        | Why It's Needed               | How to Check                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| WordPress 5.6+     | Application Passwords support | Dashboard → Updates                 |
| Administrator role | Required for API access       | Users → Your Profile                |
| HTTPS enabled      | Security requirement          | Check if URL starts with `https://` |
| REST API enabled   | Default on, rarely disabled   | Visit `yoursite.com/wp-json/`       |

## Step 1: Enable HTTPS on Your WordPress Site

WordPress requires HTTPS for Application Passwords. This is a **non-negotiable security requirement**.

### Check If HTTPS Is Already Enabled

1. Visit your WordPress site in a browser
2. Look at the address bar:
   - **Padlock icon + https://** = HTTPS enabled ✓
   - **"Not Secure" + http://** = SSL needed

### How to Enable SSL by Hosting Provider

| Hosting Provider | Steps to Enable SSL                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| GoDaddy          | cPanel → Security → SSL/TLS → Install Certificate |
| Bluehost         | My Sites → Security → SSL Certificate → Free SSL  |
| SiteGround       | Site Tools → Security → SSL Manager → Get SSL     |
| Cloudflare       | SSL/TLS → Overview → Set to "Full"                |
| WP Engine        | Dashboard → SSL → Add Certificate                 |
| Hostinger        | Hosting → SSL → Install Free SSL                  |
| DreamHost        | Panel → Certificates → Add                        |

> **Tip:** Most hosts offer **free SSL via Let's Encrypt**. If you can't find the option, contact your hosting provider's support.

### Verify HTTPS Is Working

After enabling SSL:

1. Visit `https://yoursite.com`
2. Confirm the padlock icon appears
3. Test the REST API: `https://yoursite.com/wp-json/`

## Step 2: Create an Application Password

Application Passwords are secure, revocable tokens for API access. They're safer than using your main password.

### Generate Your Application Password

1. Log in to WordPress admin: `yoursite.com/wp-admin`
2. Navigate to **Users → Profile** (or click your username in the top bar)
3. Scroll down to **Application Passwords** section
4. Enter application name: `Phoo Integration`
5. Click **Add New Application Password**
6. **Immediately copy the password** — it won't be shown again!

### Application Password Format

WordPress generates passwords like:

```
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
```

> **Important:** When entering this password in Phoo, you can include or remove the spaces — both formats work.

## Step 3: Connect WordPress in Phoo

Now you're ready to connect your WordPress site to Phoo.

### Connection Steps

1. Open your project in Phoo
2. Navigate to **Project Settings → Integrations**
3. Find **WordPress** and click **Connect**
4. Enter your credentials:

| Field                | Value                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Site URL             | `https://yoursite.com` (include https://) |
| Username             | Your WordPress **username** (not email)   |
| Application Password | The password from Step 2                  |

5. Click **Test Connection**
6. Upon success, you'll see a green checkmark ✓

### Verify Publishing Permissions

After connecting, Phoo will verify your user has:

- Post creation rights
- Media upload capabilities
- Category and tag management access

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

### "Application Passwords requires HTTPS"

**Cause:** Your WordPress site is running on HTTP, not HTTPS.

**Solutions (in order of preference):**

1. **Enable SSL** — Contact your hosting provider (see Step 1)
2. **Use Cloudflare** — Free SSL via their CDN
3. **For development only** — Add to `wp-config.php`:

```php
// ONLY for local development - never on production!
define( 'WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE', 'local' );
```

### "Invalid credentials"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Using **username** (not email address)
- [ ] Removed extra spaces from application password
- [ ] Site URL includes `https://`
- [ ] Application password not revoked

**Fix:** Generate a new Application Password and try again.

### "User does not have publishing permissions"

**Cause:** Your WordPress user role lacks publishing rights.

**Solution:** Your account needs **Editor** or **Administrator** role:

1. Log in as an Administrator
2. Go to **Users → All Users**
3. Edit your user → Change Role to **Administrator**

### "Connection failed" / Network Error

**Possible causes:**

- Site URL typo (check trailing slash)
- Maintenance mode enabled
- Firewall blocking API requests
- REST API disabled by plugin

**Diagnostic steps:**

1. Visit `https://yoursite.com/wp-json/` directly
2. You should see JSON output, not an error
3. If blocked, check security plugins (Wordfence, Sucuri, iThemes)

### "REST API is disabled"

Some security plugins disable the REST API. To enable:

**Wordfence:**

- Wordfence → All Options → Disable REST API → Uncheck

**iThemes Security:**

- Security → Settings → WordPress Tweaks → REST API → Enable

## Security Best Practices

Protect your WordPress integration with these recommendations:

| Practice                          | Why It Matters                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Use a dedicated WordPress user    | Limits access scope if compromised    |
| Never share application passwords | Each integration should have its own  |
| Revoke unused passwords           | Regular cleanup prevents stale access |
| Keep WordPress updated            | Security patches protect API access   |
| Enable two-factor authentication  | Extra layer for admin access          |

### Creating a Dedicated Publishing User

For enhanced security, create a user specifically for Phoo:

1. **Users → Add New**
2. Username: `phoo-publisher`
3. Email: Use a monitored address
4. Role: **Author** (or Editor if you need category management)
5. Generate Application Password for this user
