# How to Write Content Briefs That Get Results

**Content briefs are the foundation of great content.** Learn the exact structure and elements that make briefs effective for writers, whether human or AI.

## What is a Content Brief?

A content brief is a document that outlines everything a writer needs to create content that meets your goals. It bridges the gap between strategy and execution.

### Why Content Briefs Matter

| Without Brief        | With Brief                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Misaligned content   | Clear direction             |
| Multiple revisions   | First draft closer to final |
| Inconsistent quality | Standardized output         |
| Wasted time          | Efficient process           |
