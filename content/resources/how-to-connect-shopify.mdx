## Prerequisites

Before connecting Shopify to Phoo, verify these requirements:

| Requirement              | Why It's Needed           | How to Check                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Shopify store            | Active subscription       | Log in at `yourstore.myshopify.com` |
| Store owner/admin access | Required for app creation | Settings → Staff                    |
| Online Store 2.0 theme   | Page support              | Themes → Library                    |

## Step 1: Create a Custom App in Shopify

Phoo connects to Shopify via a private custom app. This is the most secure method.

### Navigate to Apps Settings

1. Log in to your Shopify admin: `yourstore.myshopify.com/admin`
2. Go to **Settings** (bottom-left gear icon)
3. Click **Apps and sales channels**
4. Click **Develop apps** (top-right)
5. If prompted, click **Allow custom app development**

### Create the Custom App

1. Click **Create an app**
2. Enter app name: `Phoo Integration`
3. Select yourself as the app developer
4. Click **Create app**

## Step 2: Configure API Permissions

Your app needs specific permissions to publish content.

### Required Scopes

1. In your new app, click **Configuration**
2. Under **Admin API integration**, click **Configure**
3. Enable these scopes:

| Scope                      | Permission   | Purpose                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `read_content`             | Read access  | View existing pages     |
| `write_content`            | Write access | Create and update pages |
| `read_online_store_pages`  | Read pages   | List page inventory     |
| `write_online_store_pages` | Write pages  | Publish new pages       |

4. Click **Save**

### Install the App

1. Click **API credentials** tab
2. Click **Install app**
3. Review permissions and click **Install**

## Step 3: Get Your API Credentials

After installation, you'll get your access token.

### Copy Your Credentials

1. Under **Admin API access token**, click **Reveal token once**
2. **Immediately copy this token** — it won't be shown again!
3. Store it securely (password manager recommended)

| Credential   | Example          | Where to Find                       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Shop domain  | `yourstore`      | Your URL: `yourstore.myshopify.com` |
| Access token | `shpat_xxxxx...` | Admin API access token field        |

> **Security Warning:** Never share your access token. It provides full access to your store's content.

## Step 4: Connect in Phoo

Now you're ready to connect your Shopify store to Phoo.

### Connection Steps

1. Open your project in Phoo
2. Navigate to **Project Settings → Integrations**
3. Find **Shopify** and click **Connect**
4. Enter your credentials:

| Field        | Value                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Shop Domain  | `yourstore` (without .myshopify.com) |
| Access Token | The token from Step 3                |

5. Click **Test Connection**
6. Upon success, you'll see a green checkmark ✓

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

### "Invalid API key or access token"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Access token copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- [ ] App is installed (check Apps list)
- [ ] Token hasn't been regenerated since copying

**Fix:** Regenerate the access token and copy it again.

### "Insufficient permissions to manage pages"

**Cause:** Missing required API scopes.

**Solution:**

1. Go to Settings → Apps → Develop apps
2. Click your Phoo app
3. Configuration → Admin API integration
4. Ensure `write_content` and `write_online_store_pages` are enabled
5. Reinstall the app to apply new permissions

### "Shop not found"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Shop domain is just the subdomain (e.g., `yourstore` not `yourstore.myshopify.com`)
- [ ] Store is active (not paused or closed)
- [ ] Development store hasn't been converted

### "Rate limit exceeded"

Shopify limits API calls. This typically resolves automatically.

**If persistent:**

- Wait 60 seconds before retrying
- Reduce bulk publishing frequency
- Contact Phoo support for enterprise rate limits

### "SSL certificate error"

**Cause:** Rare, usually a Shopify outage.

**Solution:**

- Check [Shopify Status](https://www.shopifystatus.com/)
- Wait and retry after 15 minutes
- Clear browser cache if using Phoo in browser
