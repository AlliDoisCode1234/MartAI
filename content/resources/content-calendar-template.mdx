## Building Your Calendar

### Step 1: Define Your Publishing Cadence

Start with what's sustainable:

| Team Size    | Suggested Pace    |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Solo         | 1-2 articles/week |
| Small (2-3)  | 2-4 articles/week |
| Medium (4-6) | 4-8 articles/week |
| Large (7+)   | Daily+            |

> **Warning**: Consistency beats volume. Start slower than you think.

### Step 2: Create Content Types

Mix different content formats:

```
Weekly Mix Example:
- Monday: Long-form guide (2000+ words)
- Wednesday: Tutorial (1500 words)
- Friday: Quick tip (500-800 words)
```

### Step 3: Plan Your Themes

Monthly or quarterly themes focus your content:

```
Q1 Themes:
- January: Planning & Strategy
- February: Tools & Technology
- March: Measurement & Analytics
```

### Step 4: Set Up Your Calendar Structure

Essential fields for each entry:

| Field        | Purpose                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Title        | Working headline         |
| Status       | Draft, Review, Published |
| Author       | Who's writing            |
| Due Date     | Draft deadline           |
| Publish Date | Go-live date             |
| Keyword      | Primary target           |
| URL          | Final destination        |

### Step 5: Add Your Content Pipeline

Track content through stages:

```
Pipeline Stages:
1. Ideation → Brief
2. Brief → Assigned
3. Writing → First Draft
4. Edit → Review
5. Review → Scheduled
6. Scheduled → Published
7. Published → Promoted
```

## Populating Your Calendar

### Content Sources

1. **Keyword research** - Data-driven topics
2. **Competitor analysis** - Gaps to fill
3. **Customer questions** - Support tickets, calls
4. **Industry trends** - News, updates
5. **Team expertise** - Subject matter knowledge

### Prioritization Framework

Rate each topic:

| Factor           | Weight | Score (1-5) |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Search volume    | 30%    | ?           |
| Business value   | 30%    | ?           |
| Ease of creation | 20%    | ?           |
| Timeliness       | 20%    | ?           |

Total = weighted average
