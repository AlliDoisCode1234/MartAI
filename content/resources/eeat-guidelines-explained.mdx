# E-E-A-T Guidelines Explained: Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust

**Google's E-E-A-T is critical for ranking.** Learn how to demonstrate experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness in your content.

## What is E-E-A-T?

E-E-A-T stands for:

- **E**xperience - First-hand experience with the topic
- **E**xpertise - Knowledge and skill in the area
- **A**uthoritativeness - Recognition as a source
- **T**rustworthiness - Accuracy and reliability

### The Evolution: E-A-T to E-E-A-T

In December 2022, Google added "Experience" to emphasize first-hand knowledge:

| Before (E-A-T)            | After (E-E-A-T)         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Expert knowledge          | + Real experience       |
| Theoretical understanding | + Practical application |
| "I studied this"          | + "I've done this"      |

## Why E-E-A-T Matters

E-E-A-T directly impacts:

1. **Search rankings** - Higher E-E-A-T = better positions
2. **Trust signals** - Users trust authoritative content
3. **YMYL topics** - Critical for health, finance, legal
