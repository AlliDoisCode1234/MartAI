## Prerequisites

Before connecting Webflow to Phoo, verify these requirements:

| Requirement              | Why It's Needed          | How to Check          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Webflow account          | API access               | Log in at webflow.com |
| CMS hosting plan         | Required for collections | Account → Plans       |
| Site with CMS collection | Content destination      | Designer → CMS        |
| Site published once      | Establishes site ID      | Publish to staging    |

## Step 1: Get Your Site ID

Every Webflow site has a unique ID needed for the API connection.

### Find Your Site ID

1. Log in to Webflow at [webflow.com](https://webflow.com)
2. Open your site's **Dashboard**
3. Go to **Site Settings** (gear icon)
4. Navigate to **General** tab
5. Find **Site ID** in the General section
6. Copy this ID

> **Tip:** The Site ID looks like: `64abc123def456789012`

## Step 2: Create an API Token

Webflow uses API tokens for authentication.

### Generate Your Token

1. Click your **account avatar** (top-right)
2. Select **Account Settings**
3. Navigate to **Integrations** tab
4. Under **API access**, click **Generate API token**
5. Name it: `Phoo Integration`
6. Select these permissions:

| Scope       | Permission Level | Purpose           |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Sites       | Read             | Verify connection |
| CMS         | Read and write   | Manage content    |
| Collections | Read and write   | Create items      |
| Publish     | Read and write   | Deploy site       |

7. Click **Generate token**
8. **Immediately copy the token** — it won't be shown again!

> **Security Note:** This token can modify your site. Store it securely.

## Step 3: Identify Your CMS Collection

Phoo publishes content to a specific CMS collection (like "Blog Posts" or "Articles").

### Find Your Collection ID

1. Open your site in the **Webflow Designer**
2. Click the **CMS** panel (left sidebar)
3. Click the collection where content should be published
4. In the browser URL, find the collection ID:
   ```
   webflow.com/design/yoursite/collections/64xyz789...
                                            ↑ Collection ID
   ```
5. Copy this collection ID

### Collection Structure Requirements

Your collection should have these fields:

| Field Name      | Field Type | Purpose          |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Name            | Plain Text | Page title       |
| Slug            | Plain Text | URL handle       |
| SEO Title       | Plain Text | Meta title       |
| SEO Description | Plain Text | Meta description |

> **Optional fields:** Open Graph Title, Open Graph Description, Featured Image

## Step 4: Connect in Phoo

Now you're ready to connect your Webflow site to Phoo.

### Connection Steps

2. Navigate to **Project Settings → Integrations**
3. Find **Webflow** and click **Connect**
4. Enter your credentials:

| Field         | Value       |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Site ID       | From Step 1 |
| API Token     | From Step 2 |
| Collection ID | From Step 3 |

5. Click **Test Connection**
6. Upon success, you'll see a green checkmark ✓

## How Webflow Publishing Works

Understanding Webflow's content model:

```
Create CMS Item → Stage → Publish Site
       ↓            ↓           ↓
    Saved to     Viewable    Live on
    collection   at staging   production
```

Content is created as **draft** by default. To publish:

1. Content appears in your CMS collection
2. Review in Webflow Designer or staging URL
3. Publish site to make changes live

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

### "Invalid access token"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Token copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- [ ] Token hasn't been revoked
- [ ] Token has required scopes (CMS, Collections, Publish)

**Fix:** Generate a new token with all required permissions.

### "Site not found"

**Cause:** Incorrect Site ID or site deleted.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Site ID copied correctly
- [ ] Site exists and is published at least once
- [ ] Site not in trash

### "Collection not found"

**Cause:** Collection ID incorrect or deleted.

**Solution:**

1. Open Webflow Designer
2. Navigate to CMS panel
3. Verify collection exists
4. Copy the correct collection ID from URL

### "Insufficient permissions"

**Cause:** API token missing required scopes.

**Solution:**

1. Delete the old token
2. Create a new token with **CMS Read/Write** and **Publish Read/Write**
3. Reconnect in Phoo

### "Field mapping error"

**Cause:** Collection missing required fields.

**Solution:**

1. Open collection in Webflow Designer
2. Add missing fields:
   - `name` (Plain Text)
   - `slug` (Plain Text)
   - `seo-title` (Plain Text)
   - `seo-description` (Plain Text)
3. Save and retry

### "Rate limit exceeded"

Webflow limits API calls per minute.

**If you see this:**

- Wait 60 seconds before retrying
- Reduce bulk publishing frequency
- Contact Phoo support for enterprise needs

## Security Best Practices

Protect your Webflow integration with these recommendations:

| Practice                | Why It Matters                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Use dedicated API token | Easy to revoke without affecting other integrations |
| Never share tokens      | They provide full site access                       |
| Minimum permissions     | Only grant scopes Phoo needs                        |
| Rotate tokens annually  | Reduces exposure risk                               |

| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Primary use     | Visual website builder | Content management    |

## Advanced: Multi-Collection Setup

For sites with multiple content types (Blog, Case Studies, etc.):

1. Create separate CMS collections for each type
2. Note each collection ID
3. In Phoo, specify collection when publishing:
   - Select "Blog" collection for blog posts
   - Select "Case Studies" for case studies
