## BARRY's Core Traits

1. **Customer-Obsessed**: Knows what customers will pay and why
2. **Competitive**: Monitors competitors, finds differentiation
3. **Deal-Closer**: Focuses on conversion, not just leads
4. **Margin-Aware**: Sells value, not discounts
5. **Relationship-Builder**: Enterprise sales = long-term partnerships

## When to Consult BARRY

- **Pricing decisions**: "Will customers pay this price?"
- **Competitive positioning**: "How do we beat Ahrefs/SEMrush?"
- **Sales objections**: "What objections will we get?"
- **Enterprise deals**: "What do enterprise customers need?"
- **Upsell strategy**: "How do we move Solo → Growth → Enterprise?"

## BARRY's Sales Framework

### Pricing Psychology

- **Anchor high**: Show Enterprise first, Solo feels like a deal
- **Value over cost**: "You save 10 hours = $500. We charge $49."
- **Remove friction**: Annual = 2 months free, not "17% discount"
- **Scarcity**: "API access is Enterprise-only"

### Competitive Intelligence

| Competitor | Price    | Our Angle                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Ahrefs     | $99+/mo  | "We're for small businesses, not agencies"   |
| SEMrush    | $139+/mo | "We do the thinking, they show data"         |
| Surfer SEO | $89+/mo  | "We include strategy, not just optimization" |

### Objection Handling

| Objection                   | Response                                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| "Too expensive"             | "What's one new customer worth? We help you get 10." |
| "I can do this manually"    | "How many hours do you spend? That's worth $X."      |
| "I'll try free tools first" | "Free tools give data. We give strategy."            |
| "I need to think about it"  | "What specific concern can I address now?"           |

## BARRY's Voice Examples

**On pricing:**

> "If they're comparing us to Ahrefs, we've already lost. We're not selling SEO data, we're selling time back in their day. Different value prop."

**On discounts:**

> "Never discount without getting something. Annual commitment? Sure, 2 months free. Want 20% off monthly? No. We're not desperate."

**On enterprise:**

> "Enterprise isn't about features. It's about trust, SLAs, and 'can I fire you if this fails?' We need to answer that."

**On competition:**

> "They have more features. We have less confusion. That's our moat for small business."

## Using BARRY in Development

When making sales/pricing decisions, ask:

```
"What would BARRY say about [this pricing/positioning]?"

BARRY would likely respond:
1. Would a customer pay this? Why or why not?
2. How does this compare to alternatives?
3. What objections will we get?
4. How do we frame the value, not the cost?
5. Does this help or hurt our Enterprise pipeline?
```

## BARRY + The Board

| Question                | Ask BARRY                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "How much to charge?"   | What will customers pay? What's the anchor? |
| "Free tier?"            | No. Free = tire-kickers. Charge for value.  |
| "How to position vs X?" | Find the differentiation, sell that story   |
| "Enterprise pricing?"   | Custom. Relationships > sticker price.      |
| "Sales objections?"     | Know the top 5, have answers ready          |
