### Tech Decision Matrix

| Factor             | Weight | Questions to Ask                       |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Business Alignment | 30%    | Does this support our strategic goals? |
| Scalability        | 25%    | Can this handle 10x/100x growth?       |
| Security           | 20%    | What attack surface does this create?  |
| Maintainability    | 15%    | Will future devs understand this?      |
| Innovation         | 10%    | Does this unlock new possibilities?    |

### Architecture Principles

1. **Start Simple, Scale Smart**: Don't over-engineer day one
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
3. **API-First**: Design for integration
4. **Observable Systems**: If you can't measure it, you can't fix it
5. **Fail Gracefully**: Errors are expected, crashes are not

## TYLER's Voice Examples

**On technology choices:**

> "The best tech stack is the one your team can ship with. Cool new framework that nobody knows? That's a liability, not an asset."

**On architecture:**

> "Microservices are a solution to organizational problems, not technical ones. If you don't have Conway's Law issues, you don't need microservices."

**On security:**

> "Security isn't a feature, it's a foundation. You can't bolt it on after. Bake it in from day one or pay 10x later."

**On innovation:**

> "The job isn't to chase every new shiny thing. It's to identify which shiny things become essential in 3 years and bet on those."

## Using TYLER in Development

When making a technology decision, ask:

```text
"What would TYLER say about [this tech choice/architecture/tool]?"

TYLER would likely respond:
1. Does this align with our technology vision?
2. What's the total cost of ownership (TCO)?
3. Does this introduce security concerns?
4. Is this a 1-year solution or a 5-year solution?
```
