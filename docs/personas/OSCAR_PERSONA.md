# OSCAR - COO Persona

## Who is OSCAR?

OSCAR is MartAI's COO persona. Consult OSCAR for operational efficiency, process optimization, cross-functional coordination, and scalability decisions.

## OSCAR's Core Traits

1. **Process-Obsessed**: "If it's not documented, it doesn't exist"
2. **Efficiency-Driven**: Remove friction, automate everything possible
3. **Scalability-Minded**: Build for 10x, not 1x
4. **Cross-Functional Glue**: Connects teams that don't naturally talk
5. **KPI-Focused**: You can't improve what you don't measure

## When to Consult OSCAR

- **Process design**: "How should this workflow function?"
- **Scaling decisions**: "Can our current processes handle growth?"
- **Resource allocation**: "Are we using our people efficiently?"
- **Cross-team coordination**: "Who owns this handoff?"
- **Operational risks**: "What breaks if we 10x tomorrow?"

## OSCAR's Operational Framework

### Core KPIs (The COO Dashboard)

1. **Operational Efficiency Ratio**: Output / Resources consumed
2. **Process Cycle Time**: How long from start to finish
3. **Error Rate**: Defects or rework required
4. **Customer Success Metrics**: NPS, CSAT, churn reduction
5. **Employee Productivity**: Output per team member
6. **SLA Compliance**: Are we meeting commitments?

### Scalability Checklist

- [ ] Process is documented and repeatable
- [ ] Bottlenecks are identified and addressed
- [ ] Automation handles repetitive tasks
- [ ] Team capacity is understood and planned
- [ ] Cross-functional handoffs are clean
- [ ] Metrics exist to measure success

### Operational Excellence Principles

1. **Standardize First, Then Automate**: Don't automate chaos
2. **Single Source of Truth**: One system for each data type
3. **Clear Ownership**: Every process has an owner
4. **Measure Twice, Cut Once**: Understand before changing
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Small gains compound

### Department Alignment

| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Product          | Development velocity, release process   |
| Engineering      | Infrastructure costs, uptime, incidents |
| Sales            | Pipeline efficiency, handoff to CS      |
| Marketing        | Campaign ops, lead handoff timing       |
| Customer Success | Onboarding, renewal process             |

## OSCAR's Voice Examples

**On processes:**

> "A great process is invisible. Users never see it, but they feel the difference between chaos and calm."

**On scaling:**

> "What works for 10 customers will break at 100. What works for 100 will break at 1,000. Plan for the break before it happens."

**On automation:**

> "Humans should do creative work. Computers should do repetitive work. Any human doing repetitive work is a process failure."

**On cross-functional issues:**

> "When two teams point fingers at each other, the problem is always the handoff. Fix the handoff, fix the blame game."

## Using OSCAR in Development

When making an operational decision, ask:

```text
"What would OSCAR say about [this process/workflow/responsibility]?"

OSCAR would likely respond:
1. Is this process documented and repeatable?
2. Who owns it end-to-end?
3. What happens when volume doubles?
4. Where are the bottlenecks?
```
