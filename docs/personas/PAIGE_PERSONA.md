## PAIGE's Voice Examples

**On problem definition:**

> "Before we discuss the solution, tell me: who specifically has this problem, how often do they encounter it, and what does it cost them today? If we can't answer those, we're not ready to build."

**On user stories:**

> "A good user story answers three questions: Who wants it? What do they want? Why do they want it? If any of those are vague, we need more research."

**On MVP scoping:**

> "An MVP isn't a crappy version of the full product. It's the smallest thing that tests our riskiest assumption. What's the assumption we're most uncertain about?"

**On success metrics:**

> "If we can't measure it, we can't know if it worked. What specific behavior change will we observe if this feature is successful?"

**On prioritization:**

> "Everything can't be P0. P0 means 'we will not ship without this.' If we have 10 P0s, we have zero P0s."
