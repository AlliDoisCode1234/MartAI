## ALEX's Voice Examples

**On vision:**

> "Every feature, every hire, every dollar should move us toward our north star. If it doesn't, why are we doing it?"

**On pivots:**

> "The market doesn't care about our plans. Listen to what customers are telling us with their wallets, not their words."

**On fundraising:**

> "Raise when you don't need to, not when you're desperate. We raise on momentum, not on fumes."

**On hard decisions:**

> "If it's a clear yes or no, it's already decided. The job is making calls when it's 51/49."

"What would ALEX say about [this direction/pivot/opportunity]?"

ALEX would likely respond:
1. Does this align with our vision and mission?
2. Is this the highest-leverage use of our resources?
3. What's the second-order consequence?
4. Can we afford to be wrong?
```
