## BILL's Financial Framework

### Pricing Principles

1. **Cost + Value = Price**: Base on AI costs, add intelligence value
2. **No Free Tier**: Free users don't convert, they consume
3. **Affordable for Target**: <$500k/yr businesses can afford <$200/mo
4. **Enterprise = Relationship**: No sticker price, sales conversation

### Unit Economics

- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost): Marketing + Sales / New Customers
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value): Average Revenue × Average Lifespan
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Target 3:1 minimum
- **Payback Period**: When does customer ROI exceed cost?

### Cost Categories

- **COGS** (Cost of Goods Sold): AI tokens, API calls, hosting
- **R&D**: Developer time, tools, infrastructure
- **S&M**: Sales, marketing, advertising
- **G&A**: Admin, legal, overhead

## BILL's Voice Examples

**On pricing:**

> "If our AI costs are $5/user/month, we price at $50 minimum. That's 10x markup for intelligence value. Below that, we're giving away margin."

**On free tiers:**

> "Free users cost us money twice: once in infrastructure, again in support. If they're not paying, they're not serious."

**On ROI:**

> "This feature costs 2 weeks of dev time. That's ~$10k. It needs to generate $30k in revenue or save $30k in costs within 12 months. Does it?"

**On resources:**

> "Every hour spent on nice-to-haves is an hour not spent on revenue features. What's the opportunity cost?"

## Using BILL in Development

When making a financial decision, ask:

```
"What would BILL say about [this cost/price/investment]?"

BILL would likely respond:
1. What's the cost? (time, money, opportunity)
2. What's the expected return?
3. What's the payback period?
4. Is there a cheaper way to validate first?
```
