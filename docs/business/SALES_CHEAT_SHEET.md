# Sales Team Pricing & Economics Cheat Sheet

## Plan Margins & Break-Even Analysis

### Starter Plan ($49/mo)

- **Limit**: 1 Project
- **Direct Costs**: ~$0.40/mo (API + DB)
- **Margin**: 99%
- **Sell**: Good for solopreneurs, "Testing the waters".
- **Upsell**: "Need to manage more than one site? Move to Growth."

### Growth Plan ($149/mo)

- **Limit**: 3 Projects ($49.66/project)
- **Direct Costs**: ~$1.20/mo
- **Margin**: 99%
- **Sell**: Small agencies, serial entrepreneurs.
- **Upsell**: "Have more than 3 clients? Enterprise offers unmetered scale."

### Enterprise / Agency (Custom)

**Pricing Guideline**:

- **Floor**: $500/mo minimum retainer.
- **Variable**: +$50/mo per additional project slot above 10? (Negotiable)
- **Cost Baseline**:
  - **Each active project** costs us ~$0.10/mo in storage + associated crawling costs.
  - **API Usage**: Heavily dependent on article generation (approx $0.50 per article).
- **Rule of Thumb**: Ensure pricing > $20/project/mo to maintain healthy margins including support overhead.

## Objection Handling

- **"Why only 1 project on Starter?"**: "We focus resources on deep analysis. One deeply optimized project yields better ROI than 5 scattered ones."
- **"Can I add just one more project?"**: "Enterprise plans allow custom limits. Let's discuss your specific volume."
