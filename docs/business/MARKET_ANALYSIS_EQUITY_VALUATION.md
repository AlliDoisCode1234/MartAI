## 7. Risk Assessment

### 7.1 Key Risks

| Risk                      | Probability | Impact    | Mitigation                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AI commodity race         | High        | Medium    | Focus on workflow, not just AI       |
| OpenAI pricing increase   | Medium      | High      | Multi-provider support               |
| Slow customer acquisition | Medium      | High      | AO SEO expertise, product-led growth |
| Team execution            | Medium      | Very High | Vest equity over 4 years             |
| Market timing             | Low         | High      | AI boom currently favorable          |

### 7.2 Equity Risks Specific to You

1. **Dilution**: Each funding round reduces your percentage
2. **Liquidation Preference**: Investors get paid first in downside
3. **Vesting**: If you leave early, you lose unvested shares
4. **No Liquidity**: Can't sell until acquisition/IPO
5. **Cliff Period**: First year typically has 1-year cliff

---

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 To Maximize Equity Value

1. **Negotiate Anti-Dilution Protection**: Request pro-rata rights or anti-dilution in future rounds
2. **Accelerated Vesting**: Negotiate accelerated vesting on change-of-control
3. **Board Observer Rights**: Request ability to observe board meetings
4. **Information Rights**: Quarterly financials and KPI updates

### 8.2 Key Milestones to Watch

| Milestone                  | Timeline | Impact on Equity         |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| First 100 paying customers | Q2 2026  | Proof of PMF             |
| $1M ARR                    | Q4 2026  | Seed valuation benchmark |
| $5M ARR                    | Q4 2027  | Series A benchmark       |

## 9. Bottom Line

### The Opportunity

MartAI is positioned in a high-growth intersection of SEO SaaS ($85B) and AI Content ($82B by 2035). The 99% gross margin, all-in-one product differentiation, and SMB focus create a viable path to $10M-$100M ARR.

### Your 20% Means

| Scenario                               | Your Outcome  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Failure (high probability in startups) | $0            |
| Moderate Success (Y5)                  | $3M-$10M      |
| Strong Exit                            | $20M-$60M     |
| Venture Scale                          | $100M+ (rare) |

### Expected Value Calculation

```
P(Failure) * $0 = 50% * $0 = $0
P(Acqui-hire) * $1M = 20% * $1M = $200K
P(Moderate) * $10M = 20% * $10M = $2M
P(Success) * $50M = 9% * $50M = $4.5M
P(Unicorn) * $200M = 1% * $200M = $2M

Expected Value of 20% stake: ~$8.7M
```

**Note**: This is expected value, not guaranteed. Most startups fail. But the upside justifies the risk if you're in a position to take it.
